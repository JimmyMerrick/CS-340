    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
    Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
    which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project 
    Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use 
    this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    I make sure that my code is spaced out nicely to make it easier to read.
    I also put comments to explain the functionality so it is easier to track 
    what is happening in that block of code. By creating a single module to 
    interact with MongoDB you can create an additional app to implement that 
    module. This CRUD module can be used for any database, by changing the 
    targeted collection and port to variables to be passed by an additional 
    module.
    
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you 
    approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare 
    requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous 
    assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in 
    the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    As a coimputer scientist I work on the projects in short broken up features
    at a time. This allows for easier testing and implentation of previous work.
    By implementing previous assignments into the projects this allowed for a 
    smoother merger of the polished project. I would always work on the CRUD
    module first. Test it. Then implement the features of the overall project in 
    short assignments as per Agile methodologies.
    
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work 
    on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their 
    work better?
    
    Computer scientists help give access to the wealth of data available at a 
    users fingertips via computers. This is important because it allows users to 
    have a great user experience and interface to manipulate and access data.
    This project can help locate animals with a map and give all personal identifing
    information about them. This can help in adoptions of these animals.
